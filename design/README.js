This document is intended to explain how promises work and why this
implementation works its particular way by building a promise library
incrementally and reviewing all of its major design decisions.  This is
intended to leave the reader at liberty to experiment with variations
of this implementation that suit their own requirements, without missing
any important details.

-

Suppose that you're writing a function that can't return a value immediately.
The most obvious API is to forward the eventual value to a callback as an
argument instead of returning the value.

/*
This is a very simple solution to a trival problem, but there is a lot of room
for improvement.

A more general solution would provide analogous tools for both return values
and thrown exceptions.  There are several obvious ways to extend the callback
pattern to handle exceptions.  One is to provide both a callback and an
errback.
*/

    setTimeout(function () {
        if (Math.random() < .5) {

        }
    }, 1000);
};

/*
There are other approaches, variations on providing the error as an argument
to the callback, either by position or a distinguished sentinel value.
However, none of these approaches actually model thrown exceptions.  The
purpose of exceptions and try/catch blocks is to postpone the explicit
handling of exceptions until the program has returned to a point where it
makes sense to attempt to recover.  There needs to be some mechanism for
implicitly propagating exceptions if they are not handled.


Promises
========

Consider a more general approach, where instead of returning values or
throwing exceptions, functions return an object that represents the eventual
result of the function, either sucessful or failed.  This object is a promise,
both figuratively and by name, to eventually resolve.  We can call a function
on the promise to observe either its fulfillment or rejection.  If the promise
is rejected and the rejection is not explicitly observed, any derrived
promises will be implicitly rejected for the same reason.

In this particular iteration of the design, we'll model a promise as an object
with a "then" function that registers the callback.
*/

var maybeOneOneSecondLater = function () {
    var callback;

        callback(1);

            callback = _callback;
        }
    };
};

maybeOneOneSecondLater().then(callback);

/*
This design has two weaknesses: 

- The last caller of the then method determines the callback that is used.
  It would be more useful if every registered callback were notified of
  the resolution.
- If the callback is registered more than a second after the promise was
  constructed, it won't be called.

A more general solution would accept any number of callbacks and permit them
to be registered either before or after the timeout, or generally, the
resolution event.  We accomplish this by making the promise a two-state object.

A promise is initially unresolved and all callbacks are added to an array of
pending observers.  When the promise is resolved, all of the observers are
notified.  After the promise has been resolved, new callbacks are called
immediately.  We distinguish the state change by whether the array of pending
callbacks still exists, and we throw them away after resolution.

/*
You can make an argument either for throwing an error or for ignoring all
subsequent resolutions.  One use-case is to give the resolver to a bunch of
workers and have a race to resolve the promise, where subsequent resolutions
would be ignored.  It's also possible that you do not want the workers to know
which won.  Hereafter, all examples will ignore rather than fault on multiple
resolution.

At this point, defer can handle both multiple resolution and multiple
observation. (see design/q1.js)

--------------------------------

There are a few variations on this design which arise from two separate
tensions.  The first tension is that it is both useful to separate or combine
the promise and resolver parts of the deferred.  It is also useful to have
some way of distinguishing promises from other values.

-

Separating the promise portion from the resolver allows us to code within the
principle of least authority.  Giving someone a promise should give only the
authority to observe the resolution and giving someone a resolver should only
give the authority to determine the resolution.  One should not implicitly
give the other.  The test of time shows that any excess authority will
inevitably be abused and will be very difficult to redact.

The disadvantage of separation, however, is the additional burden on the
garbage collector to quickly dispose of used promise objects.

-

Also, there are a variety of ways to distinguish a promise from other values.
The most obvious and strongest distinction is to use prototypical inheritance.

/*
Using prototypical inheritance has the disadvantage that only one instance of
a promise library can be used in a single program.  This can be difficult to
enforce, leading to dependency enforcement woes.

Another approach is to use duck-typing, distinguishing promises from other
values by the existence of a conventionally named method.  In our case,
CommonJS/Promises/A establishes the use of "then" to distinguish its brand of
promises from other values.  This has the disadvantage of failing to
distinguish other objects that just happen to have a "then" method.  In
practice, this is not a problem, and the minor variations in "thenable"
implementations in the wild are manageable.

resolve the promise returned by "then".

resolution is itself a promise to resolve later.  This is accomplished by
changing the resolution value to a promise.  That is, it implements a "then"
method, and can either be a promise returned by "defer" or a promise returned
by "ref".  If it's a "ref" promise, the behavior is identical to before: the
callback is called immediately by "then(callback)".  If it's a "defer"
promise, the callback is passed forward to the next promise by calling
"then(callback)".  Thus, your callback is now observing a new promise for a
more fully resolved value.  Callbacks can be forwarded many times, making
"progress" toward an eventual resolution with each forwarding.

Safety and Invariants
=====================

Another incremental improvement is to make sure that callbacks and errbacks
are called in future turns of the event loop, in the same order that they
were registered.  This greatly reduces the number of control-flow hazards
inherent to asynchronous programming.  Consider a brief and contrived example:
*/

        return 10;
    };
    return result;
};

/*
This function will either throw an exception or return a promise that will
quickly be fulfilled with the value of 10.  It depends on whether foob()
resolves in the same turn of the event loop (issuing its callback on the same
stack immediately) or in a future turn.  If the callback is delayed to a
future turn, it will allways succeed.

Message Passing
===============

If we take a step back, promises have become objects that receive "then"
messages.  Deferred promises forward those messages to their resolution
promise.  Fulfilled promises respond to then messages by calling the callback
with the fulfilled value.  Rejected promises respond to then messages by
calling the errback with the rejection reason.

We can generalize promises to be objects that receive arbitrary messages,
including "then/when" messages.  This is useful if there is a lot of latency
preventing the immediate observation of a promise's resolution, as in a
promise that is in another process or worker or another computer on a network.

If we have to wait for a message to make a full round-trip across a network to
get a value, the round-trips can add up a lot and much time will be wasted.
This ammounts to "chatty" network protocol problems, which are the downfall
of SOAP and RPC in general.

However, if we can send a message to a distant promise before it resolves, the
remote promise can send responses in rapid succession.  Consider the case
where an object is housed on a remote server and cannot itself be sent across
the network; it has some internal state and capabilities that cannot be
serialized, like access to a database.  Suppose we obtain a promise for
this object and can now send messages.  These messages would likely mostly
comprise method calls like "query", which would in turn send promises back.

---

We must found a new family of promises based on a new method that sends
arbitrary messages to a promise.  "promiseSend" is defined by
CommonJS/Promises/D.  Sending a "when" message is equivalent to calling the
"then" method.

*/

promise.then(callback, errback);
promise.promiseSend("when", callback, errback);

/*
We must revisit all of our methods, building them on "promiseSend" instead of
"then".  However, we do not abandon "then" entirely; we still produce and
consume "thenable" promises, routing their message through "promiseSend"
internally.
*/

function Promise() {}
Promise.prototype.then = function (callback, errback) {
    return when(this, callback, errback);
};

/*
If a promise does not recognize a message type (an "operator" like "when"),
it must return a promise that will be eventually rejected.

Being able to receive arbitrary messages means that we can also implement new
types of promise that serves as a proxy for a remote promise, simply
forwarding all messages to the remote promise and forwarding all of its
responses back to promises in the local worker.

Between the use-case for proxies and rejecting unrecognized messages, it
is useful to create a promise abstraction that routes recognized messages to
a handler object, and unrecognized messages to a fallback method.

*/

The last improvment to get promises up to the state-of-the-art is to rename
all of the callbacks to "win" and all of the errbacks to "fail".  I've left
this as an exercise.


Future
======


Andrew Sutherland did a great exercise in creating a variation of the Q
library that supported annotations so that waterfalls of promise creation,
resolution, and dependencies could be graphically depicited.  Optional
annotations and a debug variation of the Q library would be a logical
next-step.

There remains some question about how to ideally cancel a promise.  At the
moment, a secondary channel would have to be used to send the abort message.
This requires further research.

CommonJS/Promises/A also supports progress notification callbacks.  A
variation of this library that supports implicit composition and propagation
of progress information would be very awesome.

It is a common pattern that remote objects have a fixed set of methods, all
of which return promises.  For those cases, it is a common pattern to create
a local object that proxies for the remote object by forwarding all of its
method calls to the remote object using "post".  The construction of such
proxies could be automated.  Lazy-Arrays are certainly one use-case.
