0.2.0 - BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE
 - Changed post(ref, name, args) to variadic
   post(ref, name, ...args). BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE
 - Added a def(value) method to annotate an object as being
   necessarily a local value that cannot be serialized, such
   that inter-process/worker/vat promise communication
   libraries will send messages to it, but never send it
   back.
 - Added a send(value, op, ...args) method to the public API, for
   forwarding messages to a value or promise in a future turn.

0.1.9
 - Added isRejected() for testing whether a value is a rejected
   promise.  isResolved() retains the behavior of stating
   that rejected promises are not resolved.

 - Fixed isResolved(null) and isResolved(undefined) [issue #9]
 - Fixed a problem with the Object.create shim

0.1.7

   for compatibility on non-ES5 engines (gozala)

   and near values
