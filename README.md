Q is a tool for making and composing asynchronous promises in
JavaScript.

An asynchronous promise is an object that represents the eventual
return value (fulfillment) or thrown exception of (rejection) of a
function that could not respond before returning without blocking,
like file system, inter-process, and network operations.  An eventual
"resolution" is either a fulfillment or a rejection.

The Q module can be loaded as:

-   a ``<script>`` tag (creating a ``Q`` global variable)
-   a NodeJS module, or generally a CommonJS module,
    available from NPM as the ``q`` package.
-   a RequireJS module

Q is designed to work well with jQuery, Dojo, and as part of an
ecosystem of NodeJS NPM packages, many of which also work in browsers,
including:

-   [qq](https://github.com/kriskowal/qq)
    infinite queues, deep and shallow object resolution,
    map/reduce helpers, lazy objects (/!\ This was
    originally ``q/util`` in this package, but has moved
    into its own home due to changes in NPM 1.)
-   [q-fs](https://github.com/kriskowal/q-fs)
    file system
-   [q-http](https://github.com/kriskowal/q-http)
    http client and server
-   [q-comm](https://github.com/kriskowal/q-comm)
    remote objects
-   [jaque](https://github.com/kriskowal/jaque)
    promising HTTP server, JSGI middleware
-   [teleport](https://github.com/gozala/teleport)
    browser-side module promises

Q conforms to many proposed standards, mostly by Kris Zyp and myself,
with mentoring from Mark Miller: [UncommonJS/Promises][]
[CommonJS/Promises/A][], [CommonJS/Promises/B][], and
[CommonJS/Promises/D][].  Q is based on Tyler Close's [ref_send][] API
for [Waterken][].

EXAMPLES
--------

## ``defer``

This example provides a promise-oriented ``delay`` function
based on the callback-oriented ``setTimeout`` function.

    function delay(ms) {
        var deferred = Q.defer();
        setTimeout(deferred.resolve, ms);
        return deferred.promise;
    }


This example takes a promise and returns a promise that will
be rejected if the given promise is not fulfilled in a
timely fashion.

    function timeout(promise, ms) {
        var deferred = Q.defer();
        Q.when(promise, deferred.resolve);
        Q.when(delay(ms), function () {
            deferred.reject("Timed out");
        });
        return deferred.promise;
    }


This example wraps Node's file listing function, returning a
promise instead of accepting a callback.

    var FS = require("fs"); // from Node

    function list(path) {
        path = String(path);
        var result = Q.defer();
        FS.readdir(path, function (error, list) {
            if (error)
                return result.reject(error);
            else
                result.resolve(list);
        });
        return result.promise;
    }


## ``when``

This example illustrates how the ``when`` primitive can be
used to observe the fulfillment of a promise.

    var bPromise = Q.when(aPromise, function (aValue) {
        return bValue;
    });

*   If ``aPromise`` is fulfilled, the callback is called in a future
    turn of the even loop with the fulfilled value as ``aValue``.
*   If ``aPromise`` is rejected, ``bPromise`` will be resolved with
    ``aPromise`` (the rejection will be forwarded).
*   ``bPromise`` is eventually resolved with ``bValue``.
*   ``aPromise`` does not actually need to be a promise.  It can be any
    value, in which case it is treated as an already fulfilled
    promise.
*   ``bValue`` does not actually need to be a value.  It can be a
    promise, which would further defer the resolution of ``bPromise``.
*   If the fulfillment callback throws an exception, ``bPromise`` will
    be rejected with the thrown error as the reason.


This example illustrates how the ``when`` primitive can be used to
observe either the fulfillment or rejection of a promise.  

    var bPromise = Q.when(aPromise, function (aValue) {
        return bValue;
    }, function (aReason) {
        return bValue; // or
        throw bReason;
    });

*   If ``aPromise`` is rejected, the second callback, the rejection
    callback, will be called with the reason for the rejection as
    ``aReason``.
*   The value returned by the rejection callback will be used to
    resolve ``bPromise``.
*   If the rejection callback throws an error, ``bPromise`` will be
    rejected with the error as the reason.
*   Unlike a ``try`` and ``catch`` block, the rejection callback will not
    be called if the fulfillment callback throws an error or returns a
    rejection.  To observe an exception thrown in either the
    fulfillment or the rejection callback, another ``when`` block must
    be used to observe the rejection of ``bPromise``.

In general,

*   If the rejection callback is falsy and ``aPromise`` is rejected, the
    rejection will be forwarded to ``bPromise``.
*   If the fulfillment callback is falsy and ``aPromise`` is fulfilled,
    the fulfilled value will be forwarded to ``bPromise``.


## Node File-system Examples

In Node, this example reads itself and writes itself out in
all capitals.

    var Q = require("q");
    var FS = require("q-fs");

    var text = FS.read(__filename);
    Q.when(text, function (text) {
        console.log(text.toUpperCase());
    });

You can also perform actions in parallel.  This example
reads two files at the same time, waits for both to finish,
then logs their lengths.

    var Q = require("q");
    var FS = require("q-fs");

    var self = FS.read(__filename);
    var passwd = FS.read("/etc/passwd");
    Q.join(self, passwd, function (self, passwd) {
        console.log(__filename + ':', self.length);
        console.log('/etc/passwd:', passwd.length);
    });

This example reads all of the files in the same directory as
the program and notes the length of each, in the order in
which they are finished reading.

    var Q = require("q");
    var FS = require("q-fs");

    var list = FS.list(__dirname);
    var files = Q.when(list, function (list) {
        list.forEach(function (fileName) {
            var content = FS.read(fileName);
            Q.when(content, function (content) {
                console.log(fileName, content.length);
            });
        });
    });

This example reads all of the files in the same directory as
the program and notes the length of each, in the order in
which they were listed.

    var Q = require("q");
    var FS = require("q-fs");

    var list = FS.list(__dirname);
    var files = Q.when(list, function (list) {
        return list.reduce(function (ready, fileName) {
            var content = FS.read(fileName);
            return Q.join(ready, content, function (ready, content) {
                console.log(fileName, content.length);
            });
        });
    });


## Parallel Join

Promises can be used to do work either in parallel or
serial, depending on whether you wait for one promise to be
fulfilled before beginning work on a second.  To do a
parallel join, begin work and get promises and use nested
``when`` blocks to create a single promise that will be
resolved when both inputs are resolved, or when the first is
rejected.

    var aPromise = aFunction();
    var bPromise = bFunction();
    var cPromise = Q.when(aPromise, function (aValue) {
        return Q.when(bPromise, function (bValue) {
            return cValue;
        });
    });

For short, you can use the ``join`` function.

    var Q = require("q");
    var aPromise = aFunction();
    var bPromise = bFunction();
    Q.join(aPromise, bPromise, function (aValue, bValue) {
        return cValue;
    });

If a piece of work can be done on each value in an array in
parallel, you can use either a ``forEach`` loop or a ``reduce``
loop to create a ``done`` promise.

    var done;
    array.forEach(function (value) {
        var work = doWork(value); 
        done = Q.when(done, function () {
            return work;
        });
    });
    return done;

It is a bit more concise with a ``reduce`` loop.

    return array.reduce(function (done, value) {
        var work = doWork(value);
        return Q.when(done, function () {
            return work;
        });
    }, undefined);

You can also join the promises with a variadic ``wait``
call, which is equivalent.

    return array.reduce(function (done, value) {
        var work = doWork(value);
        return Q.wait(work, done);
    }, undefined);


## Serial Join

If you have two pieces of work and the second cannot be done
until the first completes, you can also use nested ``when``
blocks.

    var aPromise = aFunction();
    var cPromise = Q.when(aPromise, function (aValue) {
        var bPromise = bFunction(aValue);
        return Q.when(bPromise, function bValue) {
            return cValue;
        });
    });

If you can do work on each value in an array, but want to do
them in order and one at a time, you can use ``forEach`` or
``reduce`` loop.

    var done;
    array.forEach(function (value) {
        done = Q.when(done, function () {
            return doWork(value); 
        });
    });
    return done;

It is more concise with ``reduce`` and ``wait``.

    return array.reduce(function (done, value) {
        return Q.wait(done, doWork(value));
    });


## Recovery

You can use the rejection callback of ``when`` blocks to
recover from failure.  Supposing that ``doIt`` will
intermittently fail (perhaps because of network conditions),
``justDoIt`` will just keep trying indifinitely.

    function justDoIt(value) {
        var work = doIt(value);
        work = timeout(1000, work);
        return Q.when(work, function (work) {
            return work;
        }, function errback(reason) {
            // just do it again
            return justDoIt(value);
        });
    }

This will not blow out the stack because ``when`` blocks
guarantee that the fulfillment and rejection callbacks will
only be called on their own turn of the event loop.


## Conditional Array Serial Join

Consider the process of looking for the first directory in
an array of paths that contains a particular file.  To do
this with a synchronous file API is very straight-forward.

    function find(basePaths, soughtPath) {
        for (var i = 0, ii = basePaths.length; i < ii; i++) {
            var consideredPath = FS.join(basePaths[i], soughtPath);
            if (FS.isFile(consideredPath))
                return consideredPath;
        }
        throw new Error("Can't find.");
    }

To do this with an asynchronous ``FS.isFile`` is more
elaborate.  It is a serial iteration, but it halts at the
first success.  This can be accomplished by creating a chain
of functions, each making progress on the returned promise
until the matching path is found, otherwise returning the
value returned by the next function in line, until all
options are exhausted and returning a rejection.

    function find(basePaths, soughtPath) {
        var find = basePaths.reduceRight(function (otherwise, basePath) {
            return function () {
                var consideredPath = FS.join(basePath, soughtPath);
                var isFile = FS.isFile(consideredPath);
                return Q.when(isFile, function (isFile) {
                    if (isFile) {
                        return consideredPath;
                    } else {
                        return otherwise();
                    }
                });
            };
        }, function otherwise() {
            throw new Error("Can't find");
        });
        return find();
    }


THE HALLOWED API
----------------


## ``when(value, fulfilled_opt, rejected_opt)``

Arranges for ``fulfilled`` to be called:

-   with the value as its sole argument
-   in a future turn of the event loop
-   if and when the value is or becomes a fully resolved

Arranges for ``rejected`` to be called:

-   with a value respresenting the reason why the object will
    never be resolved, typically an ``Error`` object.
-   in a future turn of the event loop
-   if the value is a promise and
    -   if and when the promise is rejected

Returns a promise:

-   that will resolve to the value returned by either of the
    callbacks, if either of those functions are called, or
-   that will be rejected if the value is rejected and no
    ``rejected`` callback is provided, thus forwarding
    rejections by default.

The value may be truly __any__ value.  It can be a function.
It can be a promise.

Either callback may be falsy, in which case it will not be
called.

Guarantees:

-   ``fulfilled`` will not be called before when returns.
-   ``rejected`` will not be called before when returns.
-   ``fulfilled`` will not be called more than once.
-   ``rejected`` will not be called more than once.
-   If ``fulfilled`` is called, ``rejected`` will never be called.
-   If ``rejected`` is called, ``fulfilled`` will never be called.
-   If a promise is never resolved, neither callback will
    ever be called.

THIS IS COOL

-   You can set up an entire chain of causes and effects in the
    duration of a single event and be guaranteed that any invariants
    in your lexical scope will not...vary.
-   You can both receive a promise from a sketchy API and return a
    promise to some other sketchy API and, as long as you trust this
    module, all of these guarantees are still provided.
-   You can use when to compose promises in a variety of ways, for
    example:

INTERSECTION

    function and(a, b) {
        return Q.when(a, function (a) {
            return Q.when(b, function (b) {
                // ...
            });
        })
    }


## ``defer()``

Returns a "deferred" object with a:

-   ``promise`` property
-   ``resolve(value)`` function
-   ``reject(reason)`` function

The promise is suitable for passing as a value to the
``when`` function, among others.

Calling resolve with a promise notifies all observers that
they must now wait for that promise to resolve.

Calling resolve with a rejected promise notifies all
observers that the promise will never be fully resolved with
the rejection reason.  This forwards through the the chain
of ``when`` calls and their returned promises until it
reaches a ``when`` call that has a ``rejected`` callback.

Calling resolve with a fully resolved value notifies all
observers that they may proceed with that value in a future
turn.  This forwards through the ``fulfilled`` chain of any
pending ``when`` calls.

Calling ``reject`` with a reason is equivalent to resolving
with a rejection.

In all cases where the resolution of a promise is set,
(promise, rejection, value) the resolution is permanent and
cannot be reset.  All future observers of the resolution of
the promise will be notified of the resolved value, so it is
safe to call ``when`` on a promise regardless of whether it
has been or will be resolved.


THIS IS COOL

The Deferred separates the promise part from the resolver
part. So:

-   You can give the promise to any number of consumers and
    all of them will observe the resolution independently.
    Because the capability of observing a promise is
    separated from the capability of resolving the promise,
    none of the recipients of the promise have the ability
    to "trick" other recipients with misinformation.

-   You can give the resolver to any number of producers and
    whoever resolves the promise first wins.  Furthermore,
    none of the producers can observe that they lost unless
    you give them the promise part too.


UNION

    function or(a, b) {
        var union = Q.defer();
        Q.when(a, union.resolve);
        Q.when(b, union.resolve);
        return union.promise;
    }


## ``ref(value)``

If value is a promise, returns the promise.

If value is not a promise, returns a promise that has
already been resolved with the given value.


## ``def(value)``

Annotates a value, wrapping it in a promise, such that that
it is a local promise object which cannot be serialized and
sent to resolve a remote promise.

A def'ed value will respond to the ``"isDef"`` message
without a rejection so remote promise communication
libraries can distinguish it from non-def values.


## ``reject(reason)``

Returns a promise that has already been rejected with the
given reason.

This is useful for conditionally forwarding a rejection
through an errback.

    Q.when(API.getPromise(), function (value) {
        return doSomething(value);
    }, function (reason) {
        if (API.stillPossible()) {
            return API.tryAgain();
        } else {
            return Q.reject(reason);
        }
    })

Unconditionally forwarding a rejection is equivalent to
omitting an errback on a when call.

    Q.when(API.getPromise(), function (value) {
        return doSomething(value);
    }, function (reason) {
        return Q.reject(reason);
    })

Simplifies to:

    Q.when(API.getPromise(), function (value) {
        return doSomething(value);
    })


## ``isPromise(value)``

Returns whether the given value is a promise.


## ``isResolved(value)``

Returns whether the given value is fully resolved.  The
given value may be any value, including but not limited to
promises returned by ``defer`` and ``ref``. Rejected
promises are not considered resolved.


## ``isRejected(value)``

Returns whether the given value is a rejected promise.


## ``end(promise)``

Accepts a promise that is intended to be the last promise in
a chain of promises.  If an error propagates to the end of
the promise chain, it will be thrown as an exception and
handled by either NodeJS or the browser as an uncaught
exception.


## ``enqueue(callback Function)``

Calls ``callback`` in a future turn.


ADVANCED API
------------

The ``ref`` promise constructor establishes the basic API
for performing operations on objects: "get", "put", "del",
"post", "apply", and "keys".  This set of "operators" can be
extended by creating promises that respond to messages with
other operator names, and by sending corresponding messages
to those promises.


## ``makePromise(handlers, fallback_opt, valueOf_opt)``

Creates a stand-alone promise that responds to messages.
These messages have an operator like "when", "get", "put",
and "post", corresponding to each of the above functions for
sending messages to promises.

The ``handlers`` are an object with function properties
corresponding to operators.  When the made promise receives
a message and a corresponding operator exists in the
``handlers``, the function gets called with the variadic
arguments sent to the promise.  If no ``handlers`` object
exists, the ``fallback`` function is called with the operator,
and the subsequent variadic arguments instead.  These
functions return a promise for the eventual resolution of
the promise returned by the message-sender.  The default
fallback returns a rejection.

The ``valueOf`` function, if provided, overrides the
``valueOf`` function of the returned promise.  This is useful
for providing information about the promise in the same turn
of the event loop.  For example, resolved promises return
their resolution value and rejections return an object that
is recognized by ``isRejected``.


## ``send(value, operator, ...args)``

Sends an arbitrary message to a promise.

Care should be taken not to introduce control-flow hazards
and security holes when forwarding messages to promises.
The functions above, particularly ``when``, are carefully
crafted to prevent a poorly crafted or malicious promise
from breaking the invariants like not applying callbacks
multiple times or in the same turn of the event loop.


## ``get(object, name)``

Returns a promise for the named property of an object,
albeit a promise for an object.


## ``put(object, name, value)``

Returns a promise to set the named property of an object,
albeit a promise, to the given value.


## ``del(object, name)``

Returns a promise to delete the named property of an object,
albeit a promise.


## ``post(object, name, arguments)``

Returns a promise to call the named function property of an
eventually fulfilled object with the given array of
arguments.  The object itself is ``this`` in the function.


## ``invoke(object, name, ...arguments)``

Returns a promise to call the named function property of an
eventually fulfilled object with the given variadic
arguments.  The object itself is ``this`` in the function.


## ``keys(object)``

Returns a promise for an array of the property names of the
eventually fulfilled object.


## ``apply(function, this, arguments)``

Returns a promise for the result of calling an eventually
fulfilled function, with the given values for the ``this``
and ``arguments`` array in that function.


## ``call(function, this, ...arguments)``

Returns a promise for the result of eventually calling the
fulfilled function, with the given context and variadic
arguments.


## ``all([...promises])``

Returns a promise for an array of the fulfillment of each
respective promise, or rejects when the first promise is
rejected.


## ``wait(...objects)``

Returns a promise for the fulfilled value of the first
object when all of the objects have been fulfilled, or the
rejection of the first object to be rejected from left to
right.


## ``join(...objects, callback(...objects))``

Returns a promise for the value eventually fulfilled by the
return value of the callback, or the rejection of the first
object to be rejected from left to right.  If and when all
of the variadic object arguments have been fulfilled, the
callback is called with the respective fulfillment values
variadically.


## ``fin(promise, callback())``

Like a ``finally`` clause, allows you to observe either the
fulfillment or rejection of a callback, but to do so without
modifying the final value.  This is useful for collecting
resources regardless of whether a job succeeded, like
closing a database connection, shutting a server down, or
deleting an unneeded key from an object. The callback 
receives no arguments.


## ``end(promise)``

Accepts a promise and returns ``undefined``, to terminate a
chain of promises at the end of a program.  If the promise
is rejected, throws it as an exception in a future turn of
the event loop.

Since exceptions thrown in ``when`` callbacks are consumed
and transformed into rejections, exceptions are easy to
accidentally silently ignore.  It is furthermore non-trivial
to get those exceptions reported since the obvious way to do
this is to use ``when`` to register a rejection callback,
where ``throw`` would just get consumed again.  ``end``
arranges for the error to be thrown in a future turn of the
event loop, so it won't be caught; it will cause the
exception to emit a browser's ``onerror`` event or NodeJS's
``process`` ``"uncaughtException"``.


## ``async(generatorFunction)``

This is an experimental tool for converting a generator
function into a deferred function.  This has the potential
of reducing nested callbacks in engines that support
``yield``.  See ``examples/async-generators/README.md`` for
further information.


Chaining
--------

Promises created by the Q API support chaining for some
functions.  The ``this`` promise becomes the first argument
of the corresponding Q API function.  For example, the
following are equivalent:

-   ``when(promise, fulfilled)`` and
    ``promise.then(fulfilled)``.
-   ``end(promise)`` and ``promise.end()``.

The following functions are supported for chaining:

-   ``.when`` (``.then``)
-   ``.get``
-   ``.put``
-   ``.del``
-   ``.post``
-   ``.invoke``
-   ``.apply``
-   ``.call``
-   ``.keys``
-   ``.all``
-   ``.wait`` (``.all().get(0)``)
-   ``.join`` (``.all().when(function ([...]) {}))``)
-   ``.fin``
-   ``.end``
